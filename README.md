# PostScript Interpreter
## Switching Scoping
To switch from dynamic scoping to lexical scoping and vice a versa, simply enter "changescoping"
## Downloading and Running
Since this intepreter was made in Unity, there are two options for downloading and running. You can download via the executable or via the code and using the Unity Engine.
### Executable
1. Navigate to my PostScript Intepreter GitHub page
2. Select releases and download the .zip file
3. Unzip the folder and run the executable

### Unity Engine
1. Install the Unity Hub and Unity Engine 2022.3.52f1
2. Using git bash, clone the repository into an empty folder
3. From the Unity Hub, select "Add"->"Add project from disk"
4. Select the folder that contains the .git and other files
5. Open the project

You can then open any of the scripts in your IDE of choice. To run tests, I used the Unity test runner and all tests were passing.
